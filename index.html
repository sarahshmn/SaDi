          <h1>SADI, two of us</h1>
          <h6>
            I wanted to write you in Persian, but then I said I learned English
            from you so... let me tell you a story!
            <br />
            "On a day when she was bored to death, an angel appeared and took
            her hand. She felt a sense of familiarity, recognizing those soft
            and warm hands; she had seen him before.
            <br />
            She listened to his heavenly voice whispering, 'Don't worry!
            Everything will be alright. I believe in you!'
            <br />
            Overwhelmed by disbelief, she cried. She couldn't fathom the reality
            of an angel believing and caring for her. 'Is it real? Is there
            truly an angel who believes in me and cares for me?'
            <br />
            The angel guided her to another world, revealing its vastness. 'Look
            around, this world is immense! But fear not, I'm here. You won't
            lose your way. I'll guide you and stand by your side. Just keep
            going and give your best!'
            <br />
            Through tears, she protested, 'I can't! I'll lose my way, and you'll
            vanish! I don't want that!' The angel smiled and tenderly kissed her
            soul, helping her take the first step on that path...
            <br />
            Here lies a glimpse of what she learned in that world!
            <br />
            I've compiled our pictures to cherish those lovely moments and
            express gratitude for your presence in my life!
            <br />
            My angel, I love you, and I'm proud to be with you!"
